	"cellarMarianaDescription": "The Mariana cellar preserves the architecture of a barn: the vaulted ceiling, the beola flooring, the manger. In this place are testimonies that tell of the activities related to animal husbandry. \nAnimals were a fundamental element in the subsistence economy: they provided energy to pull wagons and work the fields, they offered products such as milk and dairy products, meat, fiber. \nOf the animal, nothing was thrown away; while pigs and chickens were sheltered in the undercrofts of courtyards, the barn housed cattle and sheep in winter. \nThe warmth produced by the animals' bodies made the barn an ideal place for processing wool, which, was sheared, washed, carded and spun by spindle or spinning wheel. The yarn, worked on irons or loom, was transformed into garments, blankets, and carpets. \nFinally, the stable was one of the very rare spaces where women could converse with some freedom during the day and, in the evening, it happened that the whole family gathered there. In the warmth they would exchange reflections on the day that was ending and on rhythms of life and work that seemed eternal. In a society where books were the exception, the oral culture handed down by the elders found its ideal school precisely in the stable.",
	"cellarGesaDescription": "Until the 1950s-60s Orino had an expanse of fields interspersed with rows of fruit trees and vines. Cereals and different horticultural varieties were grown. \nThe first phase of work in the fields involved preparing the land by fertilization: family cesspool latrines were used, the contents of which were dumped into a barrel, brought to its destination by wagon. Once deposited, the soil was given time to absorb the manure, before planting. A plow was used to turn the soil. Accounts collected revealed tales of growing rye, oats, barley, wheat, maize and millet, intercropped with vegetables. \nPeople went to harvest grains in teams, accompanying the rhythm of gestures with songs: the tools used were the messoria scythe, and another long-handled scythe. The harvesters worked in rows: with one hand they grasped the grain stalks and with the other they held the tool. With a precise gesture they would sever the sheaves. The sheaves were tied and taken to the yards for further processing. \nAll parts of the grain were used: the caryopsis was extracted from the ear, and from the rest of the plant was made straw used in the stables. Harvesting was followed by threshing, carried out in the threshing floor. The thresher held the correggiato, which, with a firm blow, detached the grain from the chaff.\nWhen the work was finished, sieves or ventilabers were used for further cleaning of the grain.",
	"cellarBurgettDescription": "This space is devoted to accounts that tell the story of manual labor by the logger.\nGoverning a forest means managing it through silvicultural forms.\nForest management was regulated by civic use, and there was a custom of managing the cutting of stump stems using the axe. The cut stems were cleared of branches and leaves with the sickle and billhook. These were tools always on hand, hanging from the work belt, accompanied by the whetstone for sharpening the blades. Larger pieces were cut into smaller parts using iron wedges and wooden mallets. All parts of the plant were used, even the dried leaves: these were used as bedding for the stable.\nLarger timber was transported by barozza, a wagon with two front wheels, pulled by a pair of oxen put to the yoke.\nFor transporting lighter loads and when there was snow cover, the schelcia was used. Transportation to the yards was followed by the preparation of firewood and opera lumber.\nSome of the evidence in the exhibition space are tools still used today for the maintenance of chestnut forests and forests more generally. In fact, chestnut farming is still practiced today, although it has evolved greatly from the late 19th century to the present.",
	"cellarFaelDescription": "Objects that tell the story of the journey from grape cultivation to winemaking are located in the Cantina dul Fael. In Orino, vines were grown in rows on terraces reinforced by dry stone walls, also used to mark property boundaries.\nVines were pruned in February, a month in which the shape of the vines was adjusted by tying the shoots. At the same time the vines were fertilized. In May, at the first leaves, pesticide was blown on the plants.\nHarvesting involved the whole family, and then the grapes were pressed into vats. \nIn the cellar there is a hopper, used to crush the grapes. The juice derived from crushing the grapes fermented in the vats. The \"ribollir de' vats\" refers to the fermentation process by yeasts in the air, which metabolize the grape sugars with the formation of ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide. \nWhen the must stopped bubbling, racking took place: the pomace was separated and the filtered must was poured into barrels to undergo a second fermentation. The pomace could be pressed with the wine press. The wine fermentation barrels were made of wooden staves and metal hoops arranged to reinforce the structure. The wine was plucked from the barrels for consumption or decanted into demijohns or flasks.",
